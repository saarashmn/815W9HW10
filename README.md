what I basically did was to add a few lines to make a 3D minimization problem (homework from last week).
I wanted to go for another function (maybe a spring, or a part of it of some sort), but I'm not the best programmer in the world, so I couldn't do it.
I just typed down a formula ( Z = 1/2x * 1/ 2y), which is nor pretty neither represents a physical concept, but it gets this code going.
whaterver.
